    <h1>Week of March 24-28</h1>
    <h3>Assignment 1:</h3> <p>Complete the <a href="https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/">Big 5 personality assessment</a>.
    Record your scores (a number from 1 to 99) for each of the five categories (O, C, E, A and N) and save them in an Excel Spreadsheet, or somewhere that you can find them during class.</p>
    
    <h3>Assignment 2:</h3> <p>Open a blank PowerPoint presentation and save it as binary-ASCII.pptx. Make a title slide with the title 'Binary numbers and the ASCII code', and your name below that.</p>
    <p>There should be one slide that explains how to write decimal numbers using ten digits and place values that correspond to powers of ten. There should be a similar slide that explains how to write binary numbers using two digits and place values that represent powers of two. Finally, there should be a slide that explains the purpose of the ASCII code, and you should paste a table of the ASCII code with binary and HTML expressions for the ASCII characters.</p>
    
    <h3>Assignment 3:</h3> <p>On Friday we did a <a href="https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/623b9a62183e6840e1dcb4bc">Blooket</a> about binary numbers for which participation grades will be given</p>

    <p>The assignment for today is to return to the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tutorial/">Geeks for Geeks HTML Tutorial</a>
        and make the following changes:</p>
    <p>1. Change the title from 'HTML Tutorial' to a better description of a web page that you would like to build. 
        It can be simple, such as 'Ratliff's webpage' or 'My favorite mathematicians', or whatever reflects your interests</p>
    <p>2. Change the text inside the paragraph from 'Hello World!' to the following text:</p>
    <p>Hello Dr Ratliff, please give me an &#38#70. My code is &#38#x1F4A9</p>
        <p>Run your code, and make sure it represents the message that you want to send. You may change the '70' to another decimal number in the 
    <a href="https://ascii-tables.com/img/ascii-table.png">ASCII table</a>, and you may change the '1F4A9' to another hexadecimal number in the Unicode 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emojis">List of emojis</a>
    <p>You can read about Unicode at <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-unicode/">Geeks for Geeks</a></p>
