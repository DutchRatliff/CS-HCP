    <h1>Friday 02 May 2025</h1>
    <p>Now that students have taken the state math tests, we will return to computer science.
    Today we will begin working on final projects, where students will demonstrate and apply some aspect of computer technology.
    The first step is to choose a topic and develop a written proposal. Students may work in groups of 2 or 3 if desired.
    When the proposal is approved, students will collaborate using Microsoft Teams to produce a product such as
    a web page, a presentation on a technological topic, a game, a survey with a presentation of results, an app, a spreadsheet of market transactions, etc.
    The proposal should be delivered as a Microsoft Word document in students' shared OneDrive folder. 
        The proposal should begin with a summary of the goals of the project. Next, the proposal should identify the technologies that will be used to develop the product. 
        The proposal should identify how these technologies will be implemented. For students working in a group, responsibilities for specific tasks within the group should be identified.
        The proposal should discuss any difficulties that may impact the final product. Finally, the proposal should conclude with the expected date and format on which the project will be delivered or presented.

    <h1>Wednesday 09 April 2025</h1>
    <h3>Happy <a href="https://css-naked-day.org" style="color:orange" target="_blank">CSS Naked Day</a></h3>
    <p>The assignment for today is to add two questions to your website, and two buttons that will reveal the answer to each question when clicked.
    The answer should be revealed as text inside your web page, rather than as an alert. The first question should be suitable to include in the quiz on Friday. As such, it should ask about one of the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Binary numbers</li>
        <li>the ASCII code</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Microsoft 365 software: Word, Excel and PowerPoint</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>The second question can be another question suitable for a quiz, or something suitable for extra credit, such as a joke whose punchline is revealed by the button.
       To write the code that will reveal the answers to your questions, you may refer to Examples 1 and 2 in the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-script-tag/" target="_blank">HTML Script Tag Tutorial</a>.</p>
    <h3>Example: What are the 10 types of people in the world?</h3>

    <button type="button" onclick="reveal()">
        Reveal Answer
    </button>
    
    <script>
        function reveal() {
            document.getElementById("reveal1").innerHTML
            = "&#x1F525 &#x1F525 &#x1F525 Those who understand binary and those who do not &#x1F525 &#x1F48B &#x1F48B";
        } 
    </script>

    <h1>Tuesday 08 April 2025</h1>
    <p>The assignment for today is to add a button to your website. 
        First, make sure you understand how <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-elements/">HTML Elements</a> work. 
        Then read about <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-attributes/">HTML Attributes</a>. 
        Once you understand the id attribute, you can create a button in HTML and make it functional using JavaScript. 
        Please read about the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-script-tag/">HTML Script Tag</a> and refer to Examples 1 and 2 in order to add functionality to your button.</p>
    
    <h1>Monday 07 April 2025</h1>
    <p>Before beginning the assignment for today, please finish any assignments from the last two weeks that you have not yet completed. 
        When all assignments have been completed, you should learn about adding lists to your website</p>
    <p>There are two types of lists in HTML: ordered lists (ol) and unordered lists (ul). Orderd lists are numbered, while unordered lists appear as bullet points. To understand the syntax for these lists, please return to the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tutorial/">Geeks for Geeks HTML Tutorial</a>, which contains a link to an explanation of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-lists/">HTML Lists</a> </p>
    <p>Your assingment for today is to create an unordered list and an ordered list, each with at least five list elements. The lists should be consistent with the topic/theme of your website. Please feel free to ask for topic suggestions.</p>
    
    <h1>Friday 04 April 2025</h1>
    <p>The assignment for today is to finish any assignments from this week and last week that you have not completed, and to place all finished assignments into the OneDrive folder that has been shared with you</p>
    <p>To Move a file into our shared folder, first click on OneDrive in the Microsoft 365 App Launcher, click on 'My files' in the column on the left side of the screen, right-click on the file you want to add to our shared folder, click 'Move To', and then select your shared folder whose title is your last name</p>
    <p>Your folder should contain the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An Excel spreadsheet with your results from the Big Five personality assessment  that meets the requirements of Assignment 1 of the week of March 24-28</li> 
        <li>A PowerPoint presentation on binary numbers and the ASCII code that meets the requirements of Assignment 2 of the week of March 24-28</li>
        <li>A Word document (or a plain text document) that contains HTML code for your website, and that meets the requirements specified in the entry for Thursday, 03 April 2025 and for Tuesday, 01 April 2025</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>Students who have completed these assignments may compete in a Blooket for either extra credit or fantastic prizes</p>

        <h1>Thursday 03 April 2025</h1>
    <p>The assignment for today is to continue building content into your web page until it satisfies the following requirements from yesterday:</p>
    <p>Your html code should contain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>at least two comments</li> 
        <li>headings of at least two sizes</li>
        <li>paragraphs to introduce content such as links and images</li>
        <li>at least three links</li>
        <li>at least one image</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>When your website meets the html content requirements, please got to the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-tutorial/">Geeks for Geeks CSS Tutorial</a> to learn about adding style to your HTML content. 
        Note that until we get access to a proper text editor, you will not be able to create a standalone 'External' CSS file, which is recommended as a best practice (but this is fine for now). </p>
    <p>In the CSS tutorial, please review the following topics:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-introduction/">Introduction to CSS</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-colors/">CSS Colors</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-comments/">CSS Comments</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-text-formatting/">CSS Text</a></p>
    <p>A good way to figure out which fonts you like is to open a blank document in Microsoft Word, type a sample sentence, then change the font using the drop-down menu near the top left of the screen</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, which sets the international standards that govern the web, has a nice <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html">gallery</a> of fonts and font families.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-fonts/">CSS Font</a></p>
    <p>After reviewing the basics of CSS, you should apply at least three different styles to different aspects of your website such as changing the paragraph font, changing text color, centering text or images, changing background color, etc. You should add a comment for each style change that you have made</p>
    <p>You can find many examples of CSS designs and code at <a href="https://www.csszengarden.com/pages/alldesigns/">CSS Zen Garden</a></p>
    <p>You can view the code for this website in the index.html file at our <a href="https://github.com/DutchRatliff/CS-HCP">HCP-CS Github Repository</a>. The website <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> allows developers to share and maintain code, and will allow you to create your own Github account to edit your own HTML, CSS and other computer programming files, as well as to display your website or app to the public on the web</p>
    
    
    <h1>Wednesday 02 April 2025</h1>
    <p>The assignment for today is to start building content into your web page. The first step is to decide what type(s) of content that you would like to explore. 
        Once you have decided upon a theme for your website, please return to the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tutorial/">Geeks for Geeks HTML Tutorial</a>
        and review the following topics:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-editors/">Editors</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-comments/">Comments</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-elements/">Elements</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-heading/">Headings</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-paragraph/">Paragraphs</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-links/">Links</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-images/">Images</a></p>

    <p>Until we get access to a proper text editor, we will use the Geeks for Geeks IDE (which we've been using), along with Notepad. The suggestion is to develop your code in Notepad so that a reefresh does not destroy your work, then paste it into the G4G IDE to test it. Then you may save it in a Word document or an email (for now).</p>
    <p>Your html code should contain comments, headings of at least two sizes, paragraphs to introduce content such as links and images, at least three links, and at least one image. Once we have enough content for a presentable web page, we will move on to styles</p>    


    
    <h1>Tuesday 01 April 2025</h1>
    Begin with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8">Motivation</a>
    <p>The assignment for today is to return to the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tutorial/">Geeks for Geeks HTML Tutorial</a>
        and make the following changes:</p>
    <p>1. Change the title from 'HTML Tutorial' to a better description of a web page that you would like to build. 
        It can be simple, such as 'Ratliff's webpage' or 'My favorite mathematicians', or whatever reflects your interests</p>
    <p>2. Change the text inside the paragraph from 'Hello World!' to the following text:</p>
    <p>Hello Dr Ratliff, please give me an &#38#70. My code is &#38#x1F4A9</p>
        <p>Run your code, and make sure it represents the message that you want to send. You may change the '70' to another decimal number in the 
    <a href="https://ascii-tables.com/img/ascii-table.png">ASCII table</a>, and you may change the '1F4A9' to another hexadecimal number in the Unicode 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emojis">List of emojis</a>
    <p>You can read about Unicode at <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-unicode/">Geeks for Geeks</a></p>
