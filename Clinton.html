I enjoy "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/One_Piece%2C_Volume_61_Cover_%28Japanese%29.jpg" I enjoy one piece because it is a great show with tons of action. 
I also enjoy "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Bleachanime.png" I like bleach because it has a vast and unique power system great story telling and its not as loud as other shows.
